# Thank you!

Thank you for participanting in this workshop.

Atlas is still a work in progress, and we would be very grateful if you could spend 5 minutes giving the developers feedback about what you liked, what didn't work, or what features you would like to see in Atlas.

You can access the questionnaire here: [LINK]

Sample questions:

1. Scale of 1-10: How easy was Atlas to navigate? 
2. Scale of 1-10: How useful did you find Atlas? 
3. Scale of 1-10: How likely would you be to use Atlas in future? 
4. Scale of 1-10: How likely would you be to recommend Atlas to others? 
5. Did you have any problems with using Atlas? 
6. Are there any features you think are missing from Atlas? 
7. Do you have any other questions or comments about using Atlas?
