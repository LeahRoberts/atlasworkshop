# Exploring Atlas

## Step 1: register for an account on [Altas](https://uat.mykro.be/)

You will find this option on the top right corner of the Atlas webpage. Note: you will receive a verification email to the email address you registered with Atlas.

If you already have an account, log in with your credentials.

## Step 2: Into the Unknown

We are going to give you some time to explore Atlas and its features independently. This will help you get a better understanding of the platform, how to navigate it and what functions you can use to explore the data. 

To help this process, we have devised some simple questions to prompt you to explore Atlas. This should take about 30 minutes. When you are done, you can check your answers [here](https://leahroberts.github.io/atlasworkshop/answers/). 


1. **how many samples are there in total on Atlas?**


2. **how many locations are represented in Atlas? Which locations have the most samples? Which have the least?**


3. **Name three ways you could search for rifampicin resistance isolates from the Sample Library page**


4. **What is the earliest sample collected in Atlas?**


5. **How many samples are Ethambutol resistant? How many are sensitive?**


6. **What is the mechanism (i.e. SNP) of moxifloxacin resistance in isolate `SAMD00029436`?**


7. **Which drugs are considered first line drugs? Which are second line drugs?**


8. **How many isolates were obtained from Japan (a) in total, and (b) between 1St January 2013 - 1st of January 2014?**


9. **How many samples are within a distance of 10 from isolate `SAMN06142915`? How many at a distance of 5?**


10. **How many MDR samples in the library? Which country has the most?**
